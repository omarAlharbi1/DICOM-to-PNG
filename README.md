# DICOM-to-PNG
convert Dicom to PNG and store metadata as JSON if you want

# How to use it
Just install PyDicom,
then just run the python file,
it will ask you to write either the folder that contains DICOM files,
or just write the DICOM file location,
after that it will ask you if you want to store the metadata or not,
if you choose 'y', it will store the metadata as json file

#NOTE: in DICOM images in default are stored as 16 bit depth, but this tool will converte the images into 8 bit depth.
